---------- NEXT STEPS ----------

Implement Speed (SPD) and Defense (DEF) in Battle
- SPD = faster turns
- DEF = damage mitigation (ATK vs DEF)

1 instance
1 boss

1 skill

---------- FUTURE STEPS ----------

Implement Magic (MAG) in Battle
- MAG = Alternate ATK stat for magic users (more damage, more healing, etc.)

---------- ISSUES ----------

- Pressing M while in any sub-menu (Equip, Item, etc.) causes StartUI to blank out entirely
- Buying out stock on the last listed item in BuyList causes the ShopCursor to get stuck where the old item button was (pressing ui_cancel can help reset the ShopUI)
- StartCursor gets stuck on UseMenu after using an item in ItemMenu
- Pressing ui_cancel at StartUI doesn't close menu

---------- CLASS IDEAS ----------

Necromancer/Summoner class
- "Siblings" function as demon/zombie spawns
- Poison-type attack using coughing, sneezing, wiping nose, etc.

---------- SKILL IDEAS ----------

Ranger
- Animal-based skills don't do "attacks," just silly stuff that will cause damage ("Dog licks viciously")
