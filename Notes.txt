---------- FUTURE STEPS ----------

Implement Magic (MAG) in Battle
- MAG = Alternate ATK stat for magic users (more damage, more healing, etc.)

---------- CLASS IDEAS ----------

Necromancer/Summoner class
- "Siblings" function as demon/zombie spawns
- Poison-type attack using coughing, sneezing, wiping nose, etc.

---------- SKILL IDEAS ----------

Ranger
- Animal-based skills don't do "attacks," just silly stuff that will cause damage ("Dog licks viciously")
