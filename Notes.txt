---------- NEXT STEPS ----------

Basic overworld map -> DONE
4 way movement (maybe even don't do animations yet) -> DONE
1 town -> DONE
1 instance
1 boss

Simple NPCs
Simple NPC interactions (press button, say thing)

---------- ISSUES ----------

HitText doesn't always display correct damage compared to Catalogable
- "Sith attacks Skeleton for 6 damage!" -> HitText shows 5
- Maybe due to bonus calculation?

FIXED -> HitText was showing the amount the enemy was taking up to it's full health, change the method to include potential damage

---------- CLASS IDEAS ----------

Necromancer/Summoner class
- "Siblings" function as demon/zombie spawns
- Poison-type attack using coughing, sneezing, wiping nose, etc.

---------- SKILL IDEAS ----------

Ranger
- Animal-based skills don't do "attacks," just silly stuff that will cause damage ("Dog licks viciously")
